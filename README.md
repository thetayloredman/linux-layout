Welcome to `linux-layout` by [thetayloredman](https://github.com/thetayloredman)!

## Woah! What is this place?

This repo is an example of how a Linux system's layout will look.

## How do I explore?

We currently only have **1** distro:

- Ubuntu *(wip)*

You can begin exploring by going to `/distros/<DISTRO>/` and reading it's `README.md`.

All directories should have a `README.md` (not normally present in the folder) explaining what the folder is for.
